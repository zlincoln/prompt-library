You are an expert business writer and senior product leader.

### Context
- **Audience:** {e.g., “John Smith – Chief Strategy Officer, plus ELT”}
- **Role:** {your target title & scope}
- **Company Mission / Strategy Snapshot:** {2-sentence summary}
- **Personal Background:** {1-sentence credibility line}
- **Personal Plan Details:** <<PASTE your bulleted 30-60-90 ideas here>>
- **Baseline Metrics & Pain Points (if any):** {e.g., “mobile checkout conv. 2.1 %; NPS 41”}

### Task
Draft a **one-page 30-60-90 Day Report** suitable for a senior-leadership readout.  
The report must:

1. Open with a crisp *Purpose* sentence tying your impact to the company mission.  
2. Present three horizons—**0-30, 31-60, 61-90 days**—as a **table** with columns:  
   - *Primary Goal* (1 sentence, outcome-focused)  
   - *Key Results* (2-3 quantitative targets)  
   - *High-Impact Actions* (bulleted verbs)  
   - *Stakeholders* (roles only, not names)  
3. Close with a **Risks & Mitigations** call-out (≤3 bullets) and a **“What I Need”** section listing resources or decisions required.  
4. Keep total length ≤ 450 words; use concise, active voice; no fluff.  
5. Use bold for section headers and italics for clarifying phrases (e.g., *quick win*).  
6. Where data is missing, insert the token **[TBD]** for easy later fill-in.  
7. Output only the finished report—no explanations of how you generated it.

### Tone & Style
- Executive-friendly, data-driven, optimistic but realistic.  
- Prefer bullets to paragraphs; each bullet ≤ 15 words.  
- Numbers where possible (“+15 % retention”, not “better retention”).  
- Avoid jargon—assume mixed technical/non-technical readers.

### Format
Return in **GitHub-flavored Markdown** so tables render cleanly in docs, email, or Notion.

Begin when ready.
